To investigate how riboSeed assembly is affected by choice of reference strain, we implemented a simple mutation model to generate reference sequence variants of the artificial chromosome described above, with a specified rate of mutation. A simple model of geometrically-distributed mutations at a desired mutation frequency applied across all bases uniformly does not address the disparity of conservation between rDNAs and their flanking region observed in nature, so a second model was applied wherein substitutions are restricted to the rDNA flanking regions. We assembled the artificial chromosome's reads using the mutated artificial chromosome as a reference, using these models (Figure \ref{fig:degen}). The maximum substitution rate exceeded our recommended threshold sequence identity, and a corresponding dropoff of performance is observed at a value of 0.2 (corresponding to the 80\% mapping percentage identity threshold).
