Sequencing bacterial genomes has become much more cost effective and convenient, but the number of complete, closed bacterial genomes remains a small fraction of the total number sequenced (Figure \ref{fig:completions}). Even with the advent of new technologies for long-read sequencing and improvements to short read platforms, assemblies typically remain in draft status due to the computational bottleneck of genome closure \cite{Nagarajan2010,Brouwer2016}. Although draft genomes are often of very high quality and suited for many types of analysis, researchers must choose between working with these draft genomes (and the inherent potential loss of data), or spending time and resources polishing the genome with some combination of \textit{in silico} tools, PCR, optical mapping, re-sequencing, or hybrid sequencing \cite{Nagarajan2010,Utturkar2014}. Many \textit{in silico} genome finishing tools are available, and we summarise several of these in Table \ref{table:tools}.
